# Attn-HybridNet --TCYB (Under Review)
[Attn-HybridNet: Improving Discriminability of Hybrid Features with Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06096)



## Features for CIFAR-100
The hybrid feature vectors for CIFAR-100 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SnqntMMqG78OG1DDGQabvr_UT4Cuv7zo?usp=sharing)
These features are reduced by applying pca on the original feature vectors.

# Dependencies
## Tensor Toolbox
Please download tensor toolbox from http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.6.html

# Future research (ideas)
- Better feature amalgamation among hybrid features
- Cross Data Generelaization Performance
